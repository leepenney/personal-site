Three blades is plenty to give a close shave and I rarely get any nicks or cuts. I've resisted the bombardment of advertising trying to get me to switch to the Fusion, who needs five blades?<br><br>As I don't use it every day, I tend to keep blades for much longer than most guys. Gillette have stated that their <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2157084/Gillette-reveals-long-razors-last.html">ProGlide Fusion blades should last up to five weeks</a>, but <a href="http://forums.digitalspy.co.uk/showthread.php?t=565495">real-world experience</a> seems to vary from a week on up. Mine typically go for a few months, though I've never actually kept track (and I probably should change them more frequently).<br><br>As such you'd think the price of a pack of blades would be less important to me, but I still begrudge paying it. A four-pack of Mach 3 'cartridges' will run you over £6, while a pack of eight comes in at around £11. Blade cartridges can cost the equivalent of several pounds each, yet <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2136440/The-great-razor-rip-Prices-blades-soar-99-just-years.html">apparently cost about 10p to manufacture</a> (no wonder Gillette can afford to advertise so much!).<br><br></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1eaar99ka0">The Subscription Model</h3><p><br>To be fair, I could go with Amazon's subscribe and save, which would give me slightly better pricing. There's also a rising number of subscription services for razor blades.<a name="more"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.dollarshaveclub.com/">Dollar Shave Club</a> grabbed a lot of press because of a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUG9qYTJMsI">great video</a> that went viral. While not the first, a service that lets you subscribe to cheap blades sounds great. They offer five two-blade cartridges a month for a dollar (update: actually it's $3 with postage). Not sure why you need that many, but still, a dollar a month.  They're not in the UK yet but I doubt it'll be a pound a month.<br><br><a href="http://www.kingofshavessub.com/">King of Shaves</a> offers a similar service in the UK already (as do <a href="http://smartershaves.com/">Smarter Shaves</a>), but at £3 a month (granted, that's for a four-blade cartridge, which is more akin to DSC's $6 a month offering). For that you get four cartridges a month, so one a week basically, which again seems high (at least for me). They do offer the ability to subscribe bi-monthly though.<br><br>If you're using a blade a week, these services work out cheap. If you're using more like a blade a month, you're going to find them stacking up while paying more.<br><br></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1eaar99ka1">The Double Edge/Safety Razor</h3><p><br>For comparison, if I went back to a safety razor (<a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/01/04/how-to-shave-like-your-grandpa/">something that seems to be in vogue</a>), I could pick up 100 blades for under a tenner. You could afford a new blade every day for less money than the other options.<br><br>I have to confess I'm tempted to give a DE (as they're known) razor a try and, judging by the settling down of the market (no more adding blades or vibrating things recently) it looks like Gillette and co are out of innovations. Ironically, there's a fairly big (relatively speaking) investment to buy all the equipment if you want to go the whole hog down the DE route (it works out cheaper in the long run, <a href="http://www.shaving101.com/index.php/education/double-edge-shaving/164-money-magazine-got-it-wrong.html">here's a nice comparison</a>).<br><br>That's not the only reason though, in fact some guys are switching back, not to save money, but to get a better shave. They're spending more on things like shaving soap, pre-shave oils and the like, as well as a lot more time.<br><br></p><h3 id="mcetoc_1eaar99ka2">The Future</h3><p><br>The cost of shaving, spread over a year, isn't that high. Even if you use a Mach 3 blade a week it costs under £80 (if you're a ProGlide Power user on the other hand, it's more like £130). It can add up though (by some calculations, switching to a DE razor <a href="http://www.shaving-shack.com/blog/the-soaring-cost-of-cartridge-razor-blades-under-the-spotlight-again/">could save you £1,000 over 20 years</a>).<br><br>Gillette have tried to keep adding more (needless) features to their razors and blades, but I can't see where else they can go. Subscription services look like they can help reduce the cost for multi-blade cartridges, and if they gain enough support, I'd expect Gillette to take notice.<br><br>Word out mouth and nostalgia seem to be the only marketing tools for DE/safety razors, but I'd be surprised if we don't see a bit more resurgence as male cosmetic products continue their rise (especially if one of the big players starts offering shaving soaps and creams).<br><br>So it could all change. One thing's for sure though: we have to keep shaving. At least until they invent some permanent hair removal cream.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
