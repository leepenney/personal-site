That’s what I thought when I stumbled across the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Hocking">Amanda Hocking</a>, a self-published author who sells her ebooks via Amazon’s Kindle store and who is estimated to have made $2 million over the last 12 months (<a href="http://amandahocking.blogspot.com/2010/08/epic-tale-of-how-it-all-happened.html">how it happened in her own words</a>).&nbsp; A publisher has (apparently, privately) stated that there is no traditional publisher in the world who could offer her a better deal than she’s receiving right now on the Kindle store.&nbsp; Having said that, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/books/amanda-hocking-sells-book-series-to-st-martins-press.html">Hocking has recently signed a $2 million four-book deal with traditional publisher St. Martin’s Press for a new series</a>, the reason:</p><blockquote><p></p><p>“I want to be a writer,” she said. “I do not want to spend 40 hours a week handling e-mails, formatting covers, finding editors, etc. Right now, being me is a full-time corporation.”</p></blockquote><p>Hocking is certainly not alone in this either, looking at the <a href="http://www.novelr.com/2011/02/27/rich-indie-writer">Kindle sales chart</a> quite a few authors sell more than enough volume to earn a living while only making $1-2 (or less) a copy.&nbsp; What’s interesting is the pricing.&nbsp; Hocking’s books retailed for either 99 cents or $2.99, with Amazon taking a 30% cut.&nbsp; That price point is important.&nbsp; At that figure people are prepared to gamble on an unknown and you open yourself up to impulse buys.</p><p>So does that mean that if you want to make money as a writer, just self-publish at the right price point?&nbsp; Well, no.&nbsp; The number of people making a living from self-published books, electronic or otherwise, is tiny, as are the number of traditional authors who make a living (though a larger number I suspect).&nbsp; Hocking writes ‘paranormal romance’ (think <em>Twilight</em>), which is a popular area read by a lot of people, one that has a strong appetite, which means they will try new authors to fill it as no one writes fast enough to keep up with consumption.&nbsp; Add this to the price point, and a lot of self-promotion and you start to see why Hocking’s books were a success (Hocking was certainly aware of writing for a market, <a href="http://selfpublishingadvisor.com/2011/04/08/amanda-hockings-road-to-success-with-indie-publishing/">see her describe her success on video</a>).</p><p>Hocking has also proved that publishers still have a place.&nbsp; One reason is to help do the things writers don’t want to (editing, formatting, distributing, promoting), another is to help authors reach a wider audience (the market for physical books is still much larger than ebooks and publishers networks are therefore invaluable).&nbsp; What it also proves is that writers have an alternate route to publishing and that publishers have a way to pick up authors who can prove their track record, rather than taking a gamble on an unknown.&nbsp; It could also be a cheap testing ground.</p><p>Some <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/laura_miller/2011/03/29/writer_sell_thyself">traditionally published authors have gone the other way though</a>, and ebooks are proving a good way to offer an author’s back catalogue (the so-called long tail).&nbsp; It should mean no author need ever be out-of-print again.&nbsp; It also shows the power of a platform, like Amazon, to allow people direct access to a market (something that is working in other markets too).&nbsp; Equally it highlights the need for people to be able to discover you and the power of promotion, services I think will start to grow as a separate industry and which traditional publishers may take a lead in.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than be afraid of ebooks and self-publishing, I think they offer great opportunities to publishers if they learn how to embrace them.&nbsp; I don’t think there will be a ‘best way’ to use ebooks, but they certainly signal a shake-up for writers and publishers and I don’t think that’s a bad thing.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
