Last year I shied away from out and out predictions, as I will do again this year, but looking at what I said it appears I failed in many areas:<br><br><br></p><blockquote>I’m still looking for a new job, I need to be a little more proactive on that. I’d like to spend some more time writing, I’ve been thinking of reserving at least one evening a week just for that, away from the computers and such, so I should probably settle on a day and have done with it. I probably should be spending less time on my 8 million websites too, and more time doing productive stuff, though I’m not sure what that is. Having said that, I’d like to get some of the List Books sister sites up and running (got the ideas and the domains have been registered). I had a nice load of books for Chrimbo, added to the backlog I already had it makes a daunting pile, so I need to get reading on them too (that means a lot more reviews coming your way). I also seemed to lose my way in the blogging stakes towards the end of the year (mainly due to social commitments, as someone who normally keeps his social engagements to a minimum I was somewhat overwhelmed in the fortnight leading up to Christmas) so I’m going to try and get back to basics.<p></p></blockquote><p><br><a name="more"></a><br>Looking back, I did manage to get a new job, that had been on the list for many years, other than that I failed miserably I'd say. I did get some more writing done, but it happened in fits and starts. Actually, I found the best method was to set a time at the end of the day when everyone had gone to bed and work on it then. I didn't manage to get the other List sites up and running, I got even more books for my birthday, as leaving presents from work and Christmas so I now have masses to read (check out the list on the <a href="http://www.thedigeratipeninsula.org.uk/reading/">reading page</a>), but I do think I've got some balance back to my blogging.<br><br>So what about 2007? Well, much as before. I'd like to spend less time working on my sites and more time writing, both for my sites and I have a screenplay and a novel I'm mid-way through. I'd like to get the other List sites up and running and make some long overdue improvements to List Books. I'm hoping to be able to buy a house. Again, I need to get reading far more and spend less time at my PC. The launch of Vista is good news I think and I'm hoping to use it as an excuse to buy a new laptop (though I'll wait a couple of months after release and I'm considering buying something that'll run OSX and Vista but I haven't decided yet), other than that, business as usual I guess.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
