I'm sure we all remember the woman who sued McDonalds after scalding her mouth on a hot cup of coffee (would she have sued because it was cold had it not been hot?), and the more recent case of a group suing several fast food chains because they believed their products were making them fat, not to mention all the cases of <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=938&amp;id=855492003">criminals suing</a> for lost earnings and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3635398.stm">such</a>.<br><br>Can someone please explain to our justice system that they should be at least trying to use a bit of common sense. The thinking should be something along these lines, surely: <em>a burglar, who was trying to steal from someone, is suing for lost earnings, because he injured himself while trying to enter someone else's house. If he wasn't trying to break the law by breaking into the house of an honest citizen, he wouldn't have been there, and therefore wouldn't have been injured. As for his earnings, well, he makes his living by stealing from others, i.e. breaking the law. Hmm, what should we do? Well, locking them away for an extra year for being a cheeky sh*t should do. Next case.</em><br><br>Unless you're talking about something way out of the ordinary, I don't think you should be allowed to sue for any everyday occurrence. By that I mean, being scalded by coffee, unless, say, the container was faulty and split, or tripping on a pavement slab. If you tripped up the stairs, or on your front doorstep, you wouldn't sue yourself, nor would you expect anyone visiting to sue you. It was an accident, carelessness by the person who tripped to be honest, and so it should be with more general issues. Maybe they should apply thinking along the lines that, would they be suing if this happened in a private residence? If not, bin it.<br><br>Incidently, if you doubt my reasoning, check out the <a href="http://www.stellaawards.com/2003.html">True Stella Awards</a>.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
