That all adds massively to the price.  Concorde, a mere supersonic craft, cost £1.3 billion in 1976, adjusted for inflation that's £8.6 billion.  Sure they were pushing the boundaries, but not like hypersonic would.  So take that figure and multiple by ten, that'd be my guess, giving you an estimated cost of £86 billion.  That's about half what the entire Apollo space program cost, for comparison.<br><br>Concorde was operated commercially by BA for a number of years, but only after having bought them at a vastly knock-down price, not what any commercial company would have charged them, which would have meant a much longer time to return investment.<br><br>Regardless, that would be fine if you could see a return on your investment, but there's no indication that there's a demand for this sort of high speed travel, which would be limited, certainly initially, to first class travellers in the same way Concorde was.  There would always be people willing to pay for speed, but even business travellers tend to look for bargains, taking multiple legs to save money.  Not to mention that the most commercial route for Concorde was London to New York, but a hypersonic plane couldn't get to altitude fast enough to do that route, ruling it out and taking out a vast amount of demand.  Other routes would open as China, India and some of the other developing nations take a bigger role in the world, but would people be prepared to save a few hours?  Let's not forget that in Concorde's heyday, the internet was barely around, now telecommuting and video conferences are growing, enabling instantaneous travel.<br><br>Lastly we have flying limitations.  Concorde was intended to fly to LA, but the US banned over-land flight due to the sonic booms it created.  Assuming the same overflight rules would apply (even extreme altitude doesn't stop it) then you limit the routes an aircraft can take significantly, having to skirt all land masses not only makes routes longer, but, as with Concorde, once at speed, these planes won't be able to change course.<br><br>So there you go, a few reasons why all the talk of hypersonic passenger jets is rubbish.  We're more likely to see the likes of sub-orbital spaceplanes, designed to climb to the upper atmosphere and then skip out and fall back into the atmosphere to generate speed and save fuel.  These will be more rocket than plane and, as such, are much closer to the current developments by commercial rocket enterprises.  But even they're a long way off.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
