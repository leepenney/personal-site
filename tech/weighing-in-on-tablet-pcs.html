for looking up recipes, quickly checking email or websites, playing media, I even have an <a href="http://www.hdhomerun.com/">HDHomerun</a> network tuner, which means I can watch live TV on it.  As <a href="http://www.thedigeratipeninsula.org.uk/archive/2010/01/19/the-iphone-inspired-diy-kitchen-touch-screen-project/">I posted a couple of days ago</a>, a tablet PC with a stand/wall bracket would be ideal for this, the touchscreen makes it all the better to interact with as it means you don’t need to have a mouse and keyboard loitering on the side, and ideal for food covered hands when cooking.  Just look at the apps on <a href="http://www.studio-lights.com/blog/iphone-inspired-kitchen-touchscreen-computer.htm">Ryan’s iPhone inspired kitchen PC</a>: to-do lists, barcode scanner, weather, photo slideshows, cooking timers, twitter client, TV, maps, music as well as internet access.  And when you’re done you can still wander around the house with it, sit on the sofa and surf, use it to look up parts or instructions when doing DIY, make video calls over VOIP.  Computers will start to appear all around the house.<br><br>There are a million-and-one uses I can think of and I’m sure many more to come.<br><br></p><h3>Pitfalls</h3><p><br>The biggest, by far, is price.  This won’t be a main PC for anyone.  Netbooks have shown people are prepared to buy a small (typically) second machine if the price is right, this is another gadget not a replacement for an existing one and, despite all the uses, it’s going to have to fight for user adoption.  As I said, they don’t need to be complicated, but Apple’s rumoured price of £8-900 is too high, it has to be below £500 and ideally in the £2-300 bracket.  I doubt Apple will hit that point, it’s not the way it operates, they’ll come in high and the Mac fanboys will be whipped into a frenzy and buy them anyway, it’ll set the benchmark and grab all the headlines but the rest of us will buy those from other manufacturers (while craving the Apple one).  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/185764/an_affordable_199_tablet_for_everyone_and_its_not_from_apple.html">Freescale have mooted one at $199</a>, the <a href="http://www.archos.com/products/imt/archos_7/index.html?country=us&amp;lang=en">Archos 7 is already available for around £250</a> and the likes of HP and Dell will be releasing them as well as a slew of manufacturers you’ve never heard of.<br><br>One thing that will need to change is the user interface.  Right now it’s designed for keyboard and mouse interaction, but touchscreens will mean simpler layouts, bigger icons, less typing, more clicking/tapping, the iPhone has laid the groundwork, but it needs to be ported to a new OS (Apple will likely just bring the iPhone OS straight over, Google’s Android is being used too).  Ryan’s PC runs XP so any OS should be capable with a certain amount of tweaking.  Apple have a good start on apps too, though I’m hoping most tablets will run a standard OS and that Windows 7’s touchscreen capabilities are up to the task, I don’t want to get tied to one vendor.<br><br></p><h3>The Future</h3><p><br>So yes, I think this year will see the rise of the table PC, but it won’t revolutionise the publishing industry as much as Jason thinks.  It’ll give it a good nudge and it’ll add some weight to the biggest issues stopping e-reader adoption: proprietary formats, price and availability.  The choice at most e-book stores is pitiful, the prices are dearer than a paperback (why, exactly?) and if I buy one I can’t guarantee I can read it on another reader.  This is what’s stopping the e-reader revolution.  The tablet PCs will only highlight these deficiencies and <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/amazon-cracks-open-the-kindle/">Amazon has already been forced to react</a> by opening it’s Kindle reader to allow third-party developers in (innovate or die).  I can see the smaller vendors going under this year.  As for newspapers and magazines, I think tablets will speed the move to paid content.  The digital revolution is coming, but we’re not th<br>ere just yet.  Having said that, I don’t think we’ll ever see the end of printed material, it’s just far too nice to interact with, some innovative publications will live in even if it’s just in certain niche markets, at least until large, flexible screens come out.<br><br>One last thing: Jas, any chance of a job on the Gadget Show?</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy;
