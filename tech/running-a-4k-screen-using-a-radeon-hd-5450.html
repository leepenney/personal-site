So the question of how to drive it arose.</p><p>In order to run it at its full resolution of 3840x2160, with a 60Hz refresh rate, I assumed I was going to need a new graphics card, so started looking around. I wanted something fairly low powered (I only have a 150W power supply), silent and less than £50.</p><p>It quickly became apparent that I would need a DisplayPort 1.2 card, which supports that resolution. The most common HDMI standard at the moment is 1.4, which only supports 3840×2160 at 30Hz. There are very few HDMI 2.0 cards available (which supports 60Hz), and they're all very expensive.</p><p>I wasn't looking to do any gaming, so didn't need anything very powerful. I was looking for cheap and quiet. That combination proved elusive though, with most cards either having a fan, not enough resolution, being quite expensive or no longer available.</p><p>I was leaning towards a new motherboard as the cheapest option. <a href="https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B85M-G43.html#hero-specification">This MSI board</a> seems to have all the right specs and I almost bought that, except I realised it's the CPU that's responsible for the graphics and my G3258, which doesn't even have a version on its Intel HD graphics, wasn't going to cut it. I'd need to buy an i3 chip at least, which made the whole bundle way more expensive than a graphics card alone.<br></p><hr id="read-more"><p>I considered an external, USB option, such as the Plugable USB 3.0 to DisplayPort 4K UHD. I was close to pulling the trigger when I realised it was only 30Hz, despite being DisplayPort. It was cheaper than most of the internal options though.</p><p>During my research I found some suggestions that even a Radeon HD 5450 could output the required resolution, albeit at only 30Hz. I figured if I was only going to get 30Hz (without spending more than I wanted and/or sacrificing to noise), I might as well explore this option. There was <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/customer-reviews/RLXUVKTO7GE8H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B0085O90YU">this comment on a VisionTek card</a>, for example. There was also <a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/cheapest-video-card-that-supports-dual-monitors-4k-60hz.1883662/">this thread at Hard Forum</a>. There were other places too, but every time I checked the official stats on manufacturer's websites they said otherwise. Even AMD's own spec sheet says otherwise.</p><p>I already had <a href="http://www.sapphiretech.com/productdetial.asp?pid=E7795F99-4278-43A6-B01E-7A62F5980F13&amp;lang=eng">this Sapphire HD 5450</a> card already, running my 30" screen, but I couldn't pick anything higher than 1920x1080 when I plugged my new screen into the HDMI port. I wondered if I could force a higher resolution somehow. Neither the Windows tools or Catalyst Control Center would let me pick it or create a custom resolution.</p><p>That led me to <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU?page=1">an application called Custom Resolution Utility (CRU)</a>, which fills in the hole left by all the default software. As it turns out, the resolution I wanted already appeared in the list it exposed. The notes in that forum post suggested I would need to patch my driver to allow a faster pixel clock. This allows for higher resolutions and refresh rates.</p><p>The notes included a link to something called <a href="http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-AMD-ATI-Pixel-Clock-Patcher">the AMD/ATI Pixel Clock Patcher</a>. It was simple enough to run and, immediately after patching it and restarting the driver (using the tool supplied with CRU) I was able to pick 3840x2160 (at 30Hz) from the resolution option in windows.</p><p>I'm limited to 30Hz because it's connected via an HDMI port, but it's perfectly liveable. The other bonus is I can still run my 30" at full resolution too. All without spending any more money.</p><p>If you're not a gamer, but want to make use of 4k, it's worth a look into what you can force your current card to do, as you might be surprised. This is a GPU that was released in 2009!</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney. All rights reserved.</p></footer></body></html>
