"He doesn't look at any of our work. He picks up a marker and goes over to the whiteboard. He draws a rectangle. 'Here's the new application,' he says. 'It's got one window. You drag your video into the window. Then you click the button that says <cite>burn</cite>. That's it. That's what we're going to make.' "<p></p></blockquote><p><br>There's no doubt Jobs was a visionary, he saw things others didn't, but what he was best at was delivering great products, great because they were products people could use, that people wanted to use, instead of clunky crap.  He didn't limit himself to what was possible today, he drove his company to find the right solution, not just a solution.  One that was right for people using</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
