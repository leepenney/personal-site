I had a birthday not too far away and I was struggling with present ideas, so I figured I could make do with a cobbled-together machine until then. Truth be told, I had been thinking about a new machine for a while, mainly because the old one kept hitting a brick wall, I think because of my obsession with keeping a lot of tabs open. So the collapse of the old one presented an opportunity.</p><p>My <a href="http://viewfinderdesign.co.uk/archive/263/my-mini-itx-build/">old mini-ITX build</a> was doing the job other than that though. So I was looking at more RAM (my suspicion for the occasional hang-ups) and I also wanted it quieter. The old mini-machine was a little noisy.</p><h3>Requirements</h3><p>I tried to sum up my requirements and I came up with:</p><ul><li>Quiet</li><li>Plenty of RAM</li><li>New SSD</li><li>Able to drive my 2560x1600 screen and a 1900x1080 second screen, with scope for 4K support in the future</li><li>Small form factor</li></ul><p>I decided I could lose the optical drive.</p><p>My experience with my HTPC has taught me two things when it comes to noise:</p><ul><li>The only silent things have no moving parts</li><li>A large enough (120mm) fan spinning slow enough may not be silent, but is largely inaudible</li></ul><p>So I wanted passive if possible, with maybe a couple of case fans if necessary.<br></p><hr id="read-more"><h3>The Parts</h3><p>Going with 120+mm fans on either the case or CPU cooler, was going to mean a bigger form factor, so I looked for micro-ATX this time instead, to give me more options to play with.</p><p>Here's what I ended up with as a spec:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Pentium G3258 (£49)</li><li><strong>Mobo</strong>: MSI B85M-E45 (£50)</li><li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 (£90)</li><li><strong>SSD</strong>: Samsung 850 EVO 250Gb (£78)</li><li><strong>PSU:</strong> PicoPSU 160-XT (previous build)</li><li><strong>CPU Cooler</strong>: Zalman FX70 (£30)</li><li><strong>Case</strong>: Sharkoon CA-M (£32)</li><li><strong>HDD</strong>: 500GB WD Scorpio Blue (previous build)</li><li><strong>Extras</strong>: Startech 8-inch 12V 4-Pin extension (£2)</li></ul><p><strong>Total</strong>: £331</p><p>I don't need a huge amount of processing power, so I opted for a Pentium instead of anything more powerful. The G3258 does give me the option to overclock should I need more power in the future (and was also the reason for the MSI board, which allows it to be overclocked).</p><p>I thought about 8GB of RAM, but wanted to run some VMs, so 16 seemed a better option. Similarly for the SSD. My previous one was 120GB, with the heavy stuff on the HDD, but I ended up going for 250GB instead.</p><p>I wanted a silent CPU cooler. I thought about the Nofan CR-80EH but in the end opted for the FX70 because it was cheaper and available faster. It took a bit of work to figure out whether I could fit it on the motherboard and in the case. In the end, I had to turn it through 90 degrees to fit it without running into the graphics card.</p><p>The case was another big decision. I wanted small, I wanted silent, but I wanted to keep it within a reasonable budget. Silent usually means sound proofing, which makes for bigger, pricier cases. I went for quieter components instead. The only reason I could fit such a large cooler was because I didn't have a standard ATX PSU and instead opted for a PicoPSU.</p><h3>The Build</h3><p>It was a tight fit, largely because the motherboard is essentially the same size as the case. The nice part of the CA-M is that you can take practically every panel off, which makes access a bit easier. Having a massive heatsink also sucked up a lot of space (although a normal ATX PSU would have done the same). I was glad I'd had the forethought to buy the 4-pin extension cable, as it was needed to reach the socket.</p><p>The SSD and HDD are mounted to the floor of the case, which made fitting them a bit of a challenge. Not only were they hard to screw in, but getting the SATA cables in place was difficult too.</p><p>The case comes with a single 120mm fan in the top. I'd been pleased with Sharkoon fans previously, so I assumed I could have this on a low setting for near silence. I was wrong, it was noisy no matter what I did. I originally had it plugged into the board and was using the BIOS to control it, but it wouldn't go below 50%. I found a video explaining how to get it lower, but this either didn't have an impact, or it was still noisy. I even tried a manual fan controller I had, but the lowest setting on that was still too noisy. I've left it disconnected.</p><h3>Build Photos</h3><p>[gallery link="file" columns="4" ids="642,645,643,644"]</p><h3>Performance</h3><p>This machine wasn't built for raw power, I simply don't need it. Responsiveness was something I was looking for and general snappiness.</p><p>It's early days, I haven't loaded the machine down with cruft and updates yet, but waking and sleeping are basically instantaneous. Boot times are good, though certainly not instant. Powering off is pretty quick too.</p><h4>Heat</h4><p>As the fan was so noisy, I tried running a few scenarios to see whether I could leave it off. For this I used good old Prime 95 to max out the CPUs for a while.</p><ul><li>With the fan (100%): 53.5°C</li><li>With the fan (low): 56°C</li><li>Without the fan: 64°C</li></ul><p><small>Measured using Open Hardware Monitor</small></p><p>I figured I could live with that. In subsequent use I haven't seen it exceed 66°C which is well inside the safe zone for a CPU.</p><h4>Power</h4><p>As ever, I was keen to keep my power consumption as reasonable as possible. It maxes out at 59W but tends to hover around 35W in general use. So not ground-breaking, but still pretty good, and despite the extra punch it's lower than the machine it replaces.</p><h4>Noise</h4><p>As you'd expect from a machine with almost no moving parts, it's very quiet. The only component that isn't silent is the HDD, which is surprisingly noisy for a 2.5" model (I have several smaller ones in other machines, none are as noisy as this one). Could I get away with just the SSD? Maybe. Could I look for a quieter HDD? It's tempting.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I largely achieved what I wanted. The only real niggles are the noisy fan and HDD. I can probably swap these out at some point, though the fan isn't really necessary unless I decide to overclock. Other than that, I have a very snappy machine for a pretty reasonable budget. Most people could get away with half the RAM and a smaller SSD, which would pay for the Pico, so the budget certainly covers a very capable machine.</p></article></main><footer><p>&copy; Lee Penney.
